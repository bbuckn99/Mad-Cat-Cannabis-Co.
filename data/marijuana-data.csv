This strain’s CBD content tends to be slightly higher than its THC profile, making this indica a great choice for those sensitive to psychoactive effects or patients treating pain, inflammation, or anxiety. With an aroma of sweet lemon and berries, Harmonia delivers functional, clear-headed effects that allow you to stay active and productive throughout the day. Don’t confuse Harmonia with its sister strain Pokie, who inherits a high-THC and low-CBD chemical profile despite being bred from the same parent genetics."
Harmony,hybrid,4.4,"Relaxed,Euphoric,Focused,Creative,Happy","Woody,Citrus,Lemon","Harmony is a hybrid that synchronizes the very best of its three parent strains, Santa Marta Colombian Gold, Lemon OG Kush, and Lemon Thai. These tall plants produce flowery, lemon-smelling buds distinctly kush-like in structure. Its effects are invigorating and uplifting, but higher doses might push you into a more spacey experience. Indoor growers wait 8 to 9 weeks for Harmony to flower while outdoor cultivators prepare for harvest in the month of October."
Harry-Potter,hybrid,4.8,"Relaxed,Happy,Uplifted,Creative,Giggly","Sweet,Citrus,Lemon","Harry Potter is an otherworldly hybrid strain that crosses Blissful Wizard with Fire Alien Kush. Bred by Sasquatch Gardens in California, Harry Potter casts a pacifying spell over the body, easing aches and pains while hushing anxiety. "
Hash-Plant,indica,4.2,"Relaxed,Sleepy,Happy,Euphoric,Hungry","Earthy,Spicy/Herbal,Diesel","One of Sensi Seeds's classics, Hash Plant stays compact during her extra-short flowering time. Her tight, resin-drenched flower clusters develop a brittle surface when dried and give off a deep, rich Afghani aroma that’s undercut with a hint of hashish. When consumed, her dominant flavor is the spicy-sharp bite of smouldering resin glands. The instant vaporization of those layers of sparkling trichomes accelerates Hash Plant’s rapid, blissful and breathtakingly powerful body-stone. This 90% indica is the product of careful genetic selection, a process that involved matching the mysterious Hash Plant original from the U.S. with Northern Lights. "
Hashbar-Og,indica,4.5,"Euphoric,Happy,Relaxed,Creative,Focused","Skunk,Sweet,Earthy","In the old days of clandestine growing, people found many strains to be unsuitable for stealthy indoor grows. Sativa strains were too large and took too long, while many indica strains smelled too strongly to go unnoticed. Enter the Pacific Northwest Hash Plant, a compact, quick-flowering, low-odor plant that still delivers large yields and tons of resin. Archive Seed Bank crossed this plant with their favorite male, the Face Off OG backcross, to create Hashbar OG, a 70% indica-dominant hybrid that generates THC levels between 20% and 24%. While the smell of this strain is light, it still delivers a nice OG flavor when smoked.   "
Hashberry,indica,4.3,"Relaxed,Euphoric,Hungry,Happy,Focused","Berry,Sweet,Mint","Voted Strain of the Year by High Times in 2006, Hashberry has a classic indica flavor with hashish undertones. Its thick stems are necessary to support the heavy buds, providing a classic aroma and flavor of mint or pepper. The effects begin swiftly and slowly plateau to the 'mellow' phase. Toward the end, a body sensation begins but leaves the consumer still social and active."
Hashplant-Haze,sativa,4.4,"Happy,Uplifted,Relaxed,Euphoric,Sleepy","Blueberry,Sweet,Orange","The uplifting high of the Hashplant Haze is enjoyable throughout the day due to it's being a sativa dominant strain. The taste is that of fruity, hashy, haziness that comes from DNA Genetics by crossing California Hash Plant and Cannalope Haze.  "

This strain originated on the island of O’ahu, near where the film Jurassic Park was shot. According to sources, Hawai’i ‘78 even became a favorite with the production crew while on site. This strain represents old school Hawaiian genetics and stimulates while imbuing the consumer with a content, mellow haze."
Hawaiian,sativa,4.2,"Uplifted,Relaxed,Euphoric,Talkative,Giggly","Sweet,Tropical,Citrus","Hawaiian is a mostly sativa hybrid that will give you a happy, vacation feeling. Creative but not so focused, this bud is great for a relaxing day. These light green buds have a sweet smell and taste that is not super potent but will bring to mind fresh tropical fruit."
Hawaiian-Cookies,hybrid,4.6,"Happy,Relaxed,Creative,Energetic,Aroused","Sweet,Citrus,Pineapple","Hawaiian Cookies is a sativa-dominant hybrid cross between Hawaiian Snow and Girl Scout Cookies that first entered the scene in 2014. From its Hawaiian Snow parent, Hawaiian Cookies inherits a tropical citrus aroma in a flavorful introduction to its potent euphoric effects. Happy, uplifting effects are following by a slight jolt of cerebral energy that lifts depression and stress while dulling pain, appetite loss, and insomnia. Its rounded bud structure and dark coloration further testify to this strain’s elite parent genetics."
Hawaiian-Delight,indica,3.8,"Happy,Relaxed,Aroused,Uplifted,Euphoric","Pungent,Sweet,Diesel","Hawaiian Delight has a strong and musky aroma, hashy finish with a pleasant after taste."
